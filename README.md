# jqueryproject
Hello, my name is Suzane Muza. This project is on how how made a search engine on GIPHY. I will be making this search engine for users to search for any word associated with a Gif. When a user puts a word in the search engine they will get a list of results to match what they're looking for.In this case they're going to search for the word 'Star' and anything associated with 'Star' will pop up in the search engine. There is 5 pages of the app. The full desktop version and small screen/tablet verison will be part of my files. I'm using html, .scss, .css, and js to complete this project.

In the future I wish to add better smoother features. When the user is searching I want the Gifs to pop faster and quicker.
