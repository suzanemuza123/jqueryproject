# jqueryproject
Hello, my name is Suzane Muza. This project is on how how made a search engine on GIPHY. I will be making this search engine for users to search for any word associated with a Gif. When a user puts a word in the search engine they will get a list of results to match what they're looking for. The full desktop version and small screen/tablet verison will be part of my files. I'm using html, .scss, .css, and js files to complete this project. I also utilized google fonts to show I can use different types of font styles and not just traditional fonts like Times New Roman.
